# Car-game

Welcome to **Car-game**, a fun and simple 2D car game I’m developing! This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it’s currently hosted live on [GitHub Pages](https://aashish-kumar77.github.io/Car-game/). The game is still in progress, but you can check out the latest version and follow its development here.

## Demo
Play the game live [here](https://aashish-kumar77.github.io/Car-game/)! (Note: Features may be incomplete as the project is under active development.)

## Features
- Basic 2D car movement.
- Simple graphics and styling using CSS.
- Interactive gameplay with JavaScript.
- (Add more features as you implement them, e.g., "Obstacle avoidance," "Score tracking.")

## Getting Started
